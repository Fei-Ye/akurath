# The fork story

Akurath project is been created  as a fork of a fantastic general purpose IDE, originally wrote by Sammy Pess√©, who is a CTO at gitbooks at the the time of writing this,   with great contributions by Aaron O'Mullan.  

When you fork a existing project, there has to be a compelling reason to do so. And it should be done only as a last resort. Before we decided to create a fork, we contemplated all the options as well as took certain steps as per the recommendation.

## Why did we create a fork ?

The reasons why we decided to create a fork were

  * CodeboxIDE/codebox project is dead for about 2 years. There are issues un addressed, pull requests pending.
  * The original authors have moved on, with all their IP including Codebox trademark being sold to another entity.
  * As per Aaron, the company which bought the IP, were keen to maintain the open source project, but seem to have not followed up on their interest to do so.
  * Since Sammy and Aaron do not own the IP and are no more maintaining it, there is no way to even transfer the project maintainer ship.
  * The code in the repository as is was in non operational state before even we started to make changes.


## I am looking for a general purpose IDE on cloud, is this a right project for me  ?

If you are looking for a general purpose IDE for developing and collaborating on cloud, we highly recommend the following tools,

  * Cloud9
  * Eclipse Che

Both are feature rich, complete IDE solutions with open source versions, come with active community support and are excellent choice for your general purpose IDE usage.   

## What does Akurath do then ?  

Akurath is been created as a special purpose devops IDE, which we plan to use as a front end engine for codespaces.io. To work with tools which allow you to write your infrastructure as a code, e.g. Chef, Puppet, Ansible, you also need to simulate infrastructure.  Codespaces.io plans to achieve this by combining the forces with docker backend which powers the containers, acting as managed nodes. And these nodes are then pre baked with the application specific utilities.   Working with this backend engine, akurath then lets you connect to and work with multiple nodes, all out of the IDE frontend.

Anyone who is looking for launching and working with  devops workspaces, codespaces.io offers the fasted way to get started, removing the barrier to provision, configure and connect the nodes in a cluster.

## Which version we have forked from ?

To take a project which is two years old, with  rapid advancement in the web technologies, our first big challenge was to actually getting it to run, and to a stage from where we could start making changes. After fiddling with the code, various previous version (0.8.3), we could find a version of code which became operational with a few tweaks.  And we have created a fork using this version.


## What are our immediate challenges?

Even with a previous version, the fork that we have created works well with its editing features and terminals. And thanks to the original authors, its simple and fantastic to use.  And those are the code functionalities we needed to  use for codespaces.io.  

In addition to We have been also able to successfully make changes and create our own addons.

Our next big challenge is to port this code and see if it would work with the latest versions of node, npm etc.  and try upgrading the modules being used.
